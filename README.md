ðŸš€ Project Overview
In this project, I developed a Next.js application with a clean and scalable architecture, following proper system design principles. The project incorporates efficient state management techniques and organized code structure.

ðŸ§  State Management
Context API â€“ Utilized for managing app-wide shared state where necessary.

Zustand â€“ Applied for minimal and flexible global state management.

React Query â€“ Used for managing server state, including:

Caching

Background data synchronization

Mutations and optimistic updates

Query invalidation and refetching

ðŸ§± Architecture Highlights
Clean folder structure with separation of concerns

Reusable components and hooks

Scalable design suitable for real-world applications

Emphasis on maintainability and performance
